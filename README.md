"A BERT Framework for Sentiment Analysis of Tweets
Overview"
This project implements a BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) framework for performing sentiment analysis on Twitter data. 
It utilizes a pre-trained BERT model fine-tuned to classify tweets into three sentiment categories: Negative, Neutral, and Positive.

The primary goal of this project is to demonstrate how pre-trained transformers like BERT can be adapted for sentiment analysis tasks with minimal training and fine-tuning. The dataset consists of Twitter data containing text and sentiment labels, which are used to train and evaluate the model.
